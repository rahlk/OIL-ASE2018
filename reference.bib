abstract="Planning, monitoring-control and termination activities are classified as Software Project Management. The most vital activity in project management is planning which states the resources required to complete the project successfully. To complete the project successfully Software Cost Estimation is very important. Software Cost Estimation is the process of predicting the cost and time required. The basic input for the software cost estimation is coding size and set of cost drivers, the output is Effort in terms of Person-Months (PM's). In this paper, we have proposed a model for tuning parameters of COCOMO model Software Cost Estimation using Multi Objective (MO) Particle Swarm Optimization. The parameters of model tuned by using MOPSO considering two objectives Mean Absolute Relative Error and Prediction. The dataset COCOMO is considered for testing the model. It was observed that the model we proposed gives better results when compared with the standard COCOMO model. It is also observed, when provided with enough classification among training data may give better results.",

abstract={A predictive model is required to be accurate and comprehensible in order to inspire confidence in a business setting. Both aspects have been assessed in a software effort estimation setting by previous studies. However, no univocal conclusion as to which technique is the most suited has been reached. This study addresses this issue by reporting on the results of a large scale benchmarking study. Different types of techniques are under consideration, including techniques inducing tree/rule-based models like M5 and CART, linear models such as various types of linear regression, nonlinear models (MARS, multilayered perceptron neural networks, radial basis function networks, and least squares support vector machines), and estimation techniques that do not explicitly induce a model (e.g., a case-based reasoning approach). Furthermore, the aspect of feature subset selection by using a generic backward input selection wrapper is investigated. The results are subjected to rigorous statistical testing and indicate that ordinary least squares regression in combination with a logarithmic transformation performs best. Another key finding is that by selecting a subset of highly predictive attributes such as project size, development, and environment related attributes, typically a significant increase in estimation accuracy can be obtained.
